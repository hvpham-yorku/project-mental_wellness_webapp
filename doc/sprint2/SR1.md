## What Went Well:
- **Core Functional Pages Were Completed**: We successfully built the login, journal, and home pages with mood sliders. All the key features are functional and meet the requirements we set out at the beginning.
- **Smooth Collaboration**: The communication between the frontend and backend teams was great. We were able to integrate the mood sliders, journal entries, and login functionality effectively.
- **API Integration Success**: The API integration for storing mood and journal entries went well, allowing us to maintain data persistence without issues.
- **Good Team Communication**: Regular check-ins and stand-ups kept everyone on the same page, helping us stay focused on the sprint goals and ensuring accountability.

## What Could Be Improved:
- **AI Model Integration Delays**: The AI model for mood evaluation was not integrated as planned. We ran into challenges, and as a result, it will be carried over into the next sprint. This will need to be a priority moving forward.
- **UI Enhancements Needed**: While the UI elements were built, there’s room for improvement in terms of design consistency, user experience, and aesthetic appeal.

## Action Items for Next Sprint:
- **Enhance the UI**: Focus on improving the overall look and feel of the app by enhancing the UI components. This includes refining the design for the login page, journal page, and home page to improve user experience and visual appeal.
- **Focus on AI Model Integration**: We’ll allocate dedicated time to properly integrate and train the AI model for mood evaluation. This will be a top priority in Sprint 2.

## Team Feedback:
- Overall, the sprint was successful in terms of completing the main functional requirements. However, the AI integration issue needs more attention, and the team agreed that it should be the primary focus for Sprint 2.
- We also agreed that enhancing the UI is a crucial improvement, and that it should be a primary focus moving forward.

---

## Decisions Made:
- **UI Enhancement** will be prioritized in Sprint 2 to ensure a polished and user-friendly design.
- **AI Model Integration** will be the main focus in Sprint 2.
