### **11th March 2025 \- Sprint 1 Stand Up 1** 

1\. What did you work on since the last standup? 

Since the last standup for Sprint 0 we have made our Trello account and designed a workspace for our project, the MindSage webapp. We have created the product backlog for our project and entered all the 20 user stories we have so far to be worked on.

2\. What do you commit to next?  

We divided up the work for this Sprint using the User Stories listed in the backlog. Every user story was analysed and assigned to group members accordingly:

1. Front end realisation and UI implementation: Chris Shi and Aishani Karfa  
2. AI Implementation: Shivail Anand  
3. Backend realisation and Database management: Avantika Nair and Nidhi Modi

Including collaboration between subgroups where required.   
Everything that was being worked on would be moved into the “In Progress” log on Trello and then go on to review for testing until the definition of done is reached, at which point it's moved to the Done log.

3\. When do you think you'll be done? 

We expect to move most of the high priority user stories into the in progress log before the second standup. The journaling page on the app would be completed by the second standup meeting, training the AI model would be in progress, the system doc file would be set up with the MVC chart and the CRC Cards and the database would be set up.

4\. Do you have any blockers? 

No blockers as it is the first meeting, any blockers that would arise will be discussed during standup 2, which was set to be held five days after standup 1\.

### **16th March 2025 \- Sprint 1 Stand Up 2**

1\. What did you work on since the last standup?

Since the last standup, our journal page is set up, the database has been set up, the login page has been created on the backend developer side, the MVC chart has been designed and the AI training has gained progress on Hugging Face.

2\. What do you commit to next?

We committed to finishing up the login page on the fronted side, finishing up the login page from the end side, making the basic AI model work and finishing up the system design document.

3\. When do you think you'll be done? 

We expect that everything we have committed to will be finished in three days and we will discuss any blockers at the meeting scheduled to be on Monday March 17th.

4\. Do you have any blockers? 

Debugging was required on the coding side during the API Integration.

### **17th March 2025 \- Sprint 1 Stand Up 3**

1\. What did you work on since the last standup?

Since the last standup we have improved on our codes and done some testing and debugging, the login pages are written and connected on both ends, the rpm.md and sprint1.md files are done and some product backlog stories are now in the review tab.

2\. What do you commit to next?

We are committing to finally integrating the AI into the webapp and testing how it functions in analysing moods when the user writes and saves a journal entry.

3\. When do you think you'll be done?   
   
We expect to be done on the day before the due date for the assignment so we can record the demo video and still have some contingency time in case a functionality on the webapp is not working properly.

4\. Do you have any blockers? 

We were having a conflict while merging a file onto the github branch but we all held a call and figured it out together and it was resolved.
