### Motivation behind MindSage
Mental health is a topic that has gained traction this past decade. With the raising awareness of lifestyle changes like managing academic stress, having work-life balance, being physically active to more serious mental illnesses like depression and anxiety -- we aim to ease the burden that the everyday person might encounter in their lives. This purpose of this project is to create a mental wellness web app that can be used to enhance the quality of the user's mental state.

## Features  
- **Write & Save Journals** – Securely log daily thoughts.  
- **Supabase Integration** – Stores journal entries in a cloud database.  
- **AI-Powered Analysis** – Provides feedback & mood analysis.  
- **Personalized Activity Suggestions** – Suggests actions based on journal content.  
- **Secure & Private** – User authentication ensures confidentiality.
