Time: 9:00 PM

Location: Discord Meeting

Participants: Aishani Karfa, Avantika Nair, Chris Shi, Nidhi Modi, Shivail Anand

# **Sprint Goal:**

The primary goal of Sprint 1 for us is to establish the foundational elements of the MindSage web app. This includes the development of core functional pages like the journal page, login page, and home page with mood sliders, with secure user data storage and efficient API integration.

# User Stories for Sprint 1:

- As a user, I want to log in to the app so that I can have a personalized account.

- As a user, I want to journal my thoughts so that I can vent.

- As a developer, I want to store the journal entries so that there is a history to inform the user.

- As a user, I want to write multiple journals a day so that if I'm having a bad day, I can vent.

- As a developer, I want to store mood entries with sliders so that there is a history to inform the user and system.

- As a user, I want to get personalized activities depending on mood/journaling so that I can improve the quality of my mood.

- As a user, I want to see different grounding/relaxation techniques so that I can rewind after a busy day.

The Journal Page will be completed to accept and securely store multiple user entries for a user.

The Mood Slider will be implemented, with data being saved to the database.

The AI model for mood evaluation through mood slider data and journal entries will be started with additional effort for continuous improvement and changes to be done in the following sprint.

Personalized activities and grounding/relaxation techniques will be suggested using the AI model to be included in this sprint.

# Spikes:

Investigating potential issues with API Integration and identifying solutions for secure and stable data flow.

Exploring optimal approaches for AI Model Training on Hugging Face to ensure accurate mood evaluation.
