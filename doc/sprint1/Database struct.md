# Database Structure Documentation for MindSage

## 1. Users Table (Handled by Supabase)
Authentication for users, including registration, login, and session management, is handled by Supabase's built-in authentication system. The relevant tables (e.g., `auth.users`) are automatically managed by Supabase.

- **Users Table:** Managed by Supabase (contains information like `id`, `email`, `password_hash`, etc.).
- **Authentication Tokens:** Supabase handles session tokens for login, access, and refresh tokens automatically.
