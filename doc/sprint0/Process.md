For sprint 0, we worked together for team.md, team-contract.pdf, and PB.md. The contents of the rest of the files were discussed with the group and agreed upon.

### Decision-Making
To make decsions, usually one of the group members suggests an idea and the entire team discusses it before coming to accept or reject the idea. If there is a group member that is not happy with a certain idea - we discuss further until we can reach a compromise.


### Prioritizing User-Stories
We defined the priority of the stories through the basic requirements of what would get the application running. Keeping in mind the goals of sprint 1, we knew we needed a working application we can demo -- along with completing the primary objective of helping people take charge of their mental health through journal entries. All user-stories related to this feature were prioritized as 1 or 2. Added features to make the app more interactive would come in sprint 2 so we prioritized them as with 3, 4, and 5 respectively. For all user-stories, we discussed extensively in our discord call on what to include and how to prioritize.


### Meetings
Our primary mode of meeting is through Discord. Usually we set meeting dates depending on everyone's schedule through the chat. We try as best as we can to have everyone attend and if it's not possible prior notice is given by the absentee. For now, we plan to have a meeting at least once a week and standup meetings every alternate day (depending on availability and requirements)


### Next Phase
For the next phase, we plan to use our setup to make the app more user-friendly like adding authentication, writing and storing journal entries, and ensuring everything is connected. We will see be having standup meetings (on alternative days or on an as needed basis) to discuss progress along with weekly meetings. Our mode of communication will be discord.
