# Done

The webapp should include a journal where user can write down their thoughts and emotions. They shouldn't be limited by how many journals they can write. The information they write should be stored and used to have activity reccommendation. There should be mood sliders which should also be be stored and used to give the user techniques to relax based on what they input. Finally, the app should have some interactive elements (like a dynamic plant reflecting the user's quality of mood/mental state).
