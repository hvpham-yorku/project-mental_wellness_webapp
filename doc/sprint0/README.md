### Motivation behind MindSage
Mental health is a topic that has gained traction this past decade. With the raising awareness of lifestyle changes like managing academic stress, having work-life balance, being physically active to more serious mental illnesses like depression and anxiety -- we aim to ease the burden that the everyday person might encounter in their lives. This purpose of this project is to create a mental wellness web app that can be used to enhance the quality of the user's mental state.

### Installation
These are the programs we used:
For backend:Python, Flask, Flask-CORS, Supabase (database)
For frontend: Node.js, npm, React, Axios, rc-slider
Dev tools: git, GitHub, VS code

Go to MindSage directory and then to backend directory. Run this:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Then go to the mind-sage-frontend directory and run the following:

The web app should run now.
