MindSage: AI-Powered Mental Wellness Companion


Primary Objective :-
"Empower users to proactively manage their mental well-being through personalized,   AI-driven insights and interventions." by:

* Leveraging AI to analyze behavioral data (mood logs, app usage) and deliver tailored recommendations.
* Using explainable AI to ensure transparency (e.g., "Your mood improved 30% after journaling")

Secondary Objectives :- 
* Reduce Barriers to Mental Health Support by:
Providing free, accessible tools to underserved groups (e.g., students, low-income users).
Lightweight design for low-end devices.
* Deliver Actionable, Personalized Recommendations by:
Using collaborative filtering to suggest coping strategies (e.g., "Users like you found yoga helpful").
Combining mood sliders and journal entries for holistic insights 

Key Users :-
* Students (18–25 years): High stress, exam anxiety, and limited access to campus counseling.
* Remote Workers: Combat isolation and burnout from overwork.
* Healthcare-disadvantaged populations: Individuals in areas with scarce mental health resources.


Key Use Cases:-
* Mood Tracking & Analysis:
Log moods via sliders/emojis; AI detects patterns (e.g., "Weekday stress peaks").
*  Interactive Personality Assessment via Choose-Your-Own-Adventure:
 Users engage in a gamified personality test modeled after "choose-your-own-adventure" stories..
* AI-Enhanced Journaling Prompts:
Users are guided through reflective journaling exercises with prompts generated by an AI model.
* Crisis Prevention:
Proactive alerts for risky trends (e.g., "Prolonged low mood detected—suggesting a breathing exercise").
* Progress Visualization
Interactive charts showing mood trends and coping strategy effectiveness.

Key Scenarios:-
* Scenario 1: Exam Stress
User logs high stress via a slider.
AI suggests a 5-minute meditation and flags a pattern of weekend anxiety.
* Scenario 2: Burnout Prevention
Remote worker logs fatigue for 3+ days.
App recommends a screen-time break and shares a CBT-based exercise.
* Scenario 3: Crisis Support
User writes, "I can’t handle this anymore."
AI responds by sharing local helpline resources.

Key Principles:-

* User Empowerment over System Complexity:
We’re focusing on making the app super easy for users to take charge of their mental health, even if that means leaving out some fancy technical stuff.
Not everyone using the app is going to be a tech savy, so keeping things simple and intuitive is key. 


* Personalization over Generalization:
The app should feel like it’s made just for you , even if it takes extra work to train AI models or integrate personalized features. Giving generic advice like "Try meditating" isn’t as helpful as saying something specific like "You’ve been feeling anxious after work—here’s a breathing exercise to try." Tailoring recommendations makes the app way more useful.


* Accessibility over Aesthetics:
We’re prioritizing making the app usable for everyone over making it look super sleek or flashy. Mental health tools need to be accessible to all kinds of people, including those with disabilities or older devices. If someone can’t use the app because it’s too complicated or only works online, then it’s not doing its job.
